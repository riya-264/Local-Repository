# This is my readme file for the Casino Game
## The casino game is designed for single-player participation. Players are required to make a deposit according to the specified on-screen conditions. Subsequently, they must allocate a portion of their deposit to a gamble. Following this, players choose a number within a given range. The program then generates a random number, and if it matches the player's chosen number, they win a substantial amount; otherwise, they incur a loss.
